Modelling flutter by using the p method as described in the textbook Hodges D.H., Pierce G.A. Introduction to Structural Dynamics and Aeroelasticity. This method provides a lower bound for the flutter speed.

Flutter speed, divergence speed are calculated and the modal frequency vs speed diagrams are shown, with the flutter boundaries.

I recreate the example shown in the textbook by using the same physical and geometrical parameters.
